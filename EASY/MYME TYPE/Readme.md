# MIME types

_MIME_ types are used in numerous internet protocols to associate a media type (html, image, video ...) with the content sent. The _MIME_ type is generally inferred from the extension of the file to be sent.
You have to write a program that makes it possible to detect the _MIME_ type of a file based on its name.

You are provided with a table which associates _MIME_ types to file extensions. You are also given a list of names of files to be transferred and for each one of these files, you must find the _MIME_ type to be used.

The extension of a file is defined as the substring which follows the last occurrence, if any, of the dot character within the file name.

If the extension for a given file can be found in the association table (case insensitive, e.g. TXT is treated the same way as txt), then print the corresponding _MIME_ type. If it is not possible to find the _MIME_ type corresponding to a file, or if the file doesnâ€™t have an extension, print UNKNOWN.

## Input

* **Line 1**: Number N of elements which make up the association table.
* **Line 2**: Number Q of file names to be analyzed.
* **N following lines**: One file extension per line and the corresponding _MIME_ type (separated by a blank space).
* **Q following lines**: One file name per line.

## Output

For each of the Q filenames, display on a line the corresponding _MIME_ type. If there is no corresponding type, then display ``UNKNOWN``.

## Constraints

* 0 < N < 10000
* 0 < Q < 10000
* File extensions are composed of a maximum of 10 alphanumerical ASCII characters.
* _MIME_ types are composed of a maximum 50 alphanumerical and punctuation ASCII characters.
* File names are composed of a maximum of 256 alphanumerical ASCII characters and dots (full stops).
* There are no spaces in the file names, extensions or _MIME_ types.

## Example

    Input

        2
        4
        html text/html
        png image/png
        test.html
        noextension
        portrait.png
        doc.TXT

    Output

        text/html
        UNKNOWN
        image/png
        UNKNOWN

## Conditions

* Timeout: 1 seconds
* The program has to read inputs from standard input
* The program has to write the solution to standard output
* The program must run in the test environment
