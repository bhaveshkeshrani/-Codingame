The program:
You must output for each participant in a race the traveled distance (in meters) at a given speed S (centimeters/second) in given amount of time T (minutes).

INPUT:
Line 1: An integer N for the number of participants.
Next N lines: Two space separated integers S and T representing respectively the speed S and the time T.

OUTPUT:
N Lines: An Integer representing the distance traveled.

CONSTRAINTS:
0 ≤ S ≤ 150
0 ≤ T ≤ 100000

EXAMPLE:
Input
1
20 10
Output
120
